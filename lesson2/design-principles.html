		<h2>Hick's Law</h2>
		<h3>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</h3>
		<p>Hick's law states: the time required to make a choice increases with the number of choices available.
		In order words, with each additional choice is an increase in the time required to make a choice.</p>

		<p>The ldschurch.jp homepage shows an example of limiting choices in order to help users make a choice.
		The number of available links are limited in order to guide the user to what they are looking for.</p>

		<h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
		<h3>Kimono Rental</h3>
		<p>The principle of visual hierarchy is explained as the ranking made by visual perception. In other words,
		it's the order in which the user sees the items on a page.</p>
		<img src="https://hmiyagi1.github.io/lesson2/image/kimono.jpg" width=200px; alt="placeholder image">
		
		<p>In the example image, the most important visual is the lady in the kimono.  The secondary points are placed 
		up front with buttons and links but the color and largest centered visual is the kimono. The user therefore knows 
		this is a website focused on kimono.</p>

		<h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
		<h3>Hirakata City</h3>
		<p>The time to move to a given target is dependent on distance and size. 
		In other words, the bigger the target and the closer it is the easier/faster it is to get to it.</p>
		<img src="https://hmiyagi1.github.io/lesson2/image/hirakata.jpg" width=200px; alt="placeholder image">
		<p>In the example image, the layout includes a large cross and megaphone in case of an emergency. The large size makes it a big target
		and easy to access.  This is due to the fact this location experiences many natural disasters and citizens need to 
		contact authorities from this site.</p>
